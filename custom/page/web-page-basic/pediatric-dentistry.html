					<p>Regularly brushing and flossing the teeth can help prevent cavities, but what else can be done? Here are some additional prevention options:</p>

					<h2>Sealants</h2>
					<p>A sealant is a type of plastic material that a dentist can glue to the tooth to fill in any deep grooves or pits on the biting surfaces of the teeth. Since the tiny grooves cannot be cleaned with a toothbrush, these areas of the teeth are susceptible to cavities.</p>

					<h2>Fluoride</h2>
					<p>Fluoride inhibits the leeching of minerals from the teeth and can help strengthen areas of the teeth where the loss of minerals has already occurred</p>
					<p>The pediatric dentist will recommend fluoride treatments for your child based on the exam—children who are at higher risk of developing cavities benefit the most from applications of fluoride.</p>

					<h2>MI Paste</h2>
					<p>MI Paste can be used as an alternative to fluoride treatments to help strengthen the teeth. This topical crème contains phosphate and calcium—two key minerals that help protect teeth from cavities.</p>
					<p>The pediatric dentist can show you how to apply the MI Paste to your child’s teeth so you can continue using it at home. Unlike fluoride treatments, MI Paste needs to be applied more frequently for effectiveness.</p>

				<h2>Nitrous Oxide Sedation</h2>
				<p>Commonly known as “laughing gas,” this is a mild and safe form of sedation used for kids of all ages. It’s beneficial for children who have mild dental anxiety. Using nitrous oxide sedation can help your child experience a sense of well-being and relaxation during the dental visit, so that he or she will respond more positively.</p>
				<p>Your child remains fully awake while breathing the nitrous oxide, and the effects of the sedation are eliminated after a short period of breathing oxygen with no lingering effects.</p>

					<h2>General Anaesthesia for Kids</h2>
					<h3>Does your child need general anaesthesia?</h3>
					<p>General anaesthesia is for children with severe dental fear and anxiety who cannot cope with multiple dental appointments. It’s also for very young children who don’t understand how to cooperate in the dental chair. </p>

					<h2>General Anaesthesia for Kids</h2>
					<h3>How does it work?</h3>
					<p>Your child is put completely to sleep and is unaware of his or her surroundings. The general anaesthesia is administered by a board-certified medical anaesthesiologist who monitors your child closely while the pediatric dentist completes the necessary treatment with his assisting dental assistant. In addition, a registered nurse will help with starting procedures and the recovery stage.</p>

				<h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2>

				<h3>Improve your child’s diet and nutrition to avoid cavities and decrease decay and gum diseases. </h3>

				<p>Follow these tips to help your child make tooth-friendly food choices:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Limit sugary foods or drinks, sticky foods, and simple carbohydrates. Most people know candies, pop, cake, cookies, and other sugary foods are bad for our teeth. But be careful! Other foods you might think are healthy can be full of sugar. This includes juice, dried fruit, yogurt, bagels, and crackers. </li>
				
					<li>Eat only fresh fruit, vegetables, firm cheeses, and nuts for snacks between meals. </li>

					<li>Drink only water between meals. Water is good not only because it doesn’t cause cavities, but also because it rinses away food and bacteria, and neutralizes any acids in the mouth. </li>

				<h2>Pacifier and Thumb Sucking</h2>
				<h3>Breaking the habit</h3>
				<p>It’s completely normal for babies and very young children to suck on their thumbs, fingers, toys, or blankets. If, however, this habit continues past the age of three, it can affect the way the teeth and jaws are growing.</p>
				<p>Most children will be able to stop the habit on their own with consistent reminders from parents and the pediatric dentist. In some cases, however, these reminders are not enough and we have to help your child with an appliance.</p>

				<h2>Oral Hygiene for Children</h2>

				<h3>How can you encourage healthy oral hygiene for kids?</h3>

				<p>Follow these tips to keep your child’s teeth healthy and clean:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Remove bacteria from the teeth by brushing at least twice a day—once in the morning and once before bed—for at least two minutes.</li>
				
					<li>Use a fluoridated toothpaste. For children under three years old, use just a smear—about the size of a grain of rice. For children three or older, use a pea-sized amount.</li>

					<li>Floss in between any teeth that are touching once a day. When the teeth are touching, cavities can easily start between the teeth if not cleaned regularly. </li>
					<li>Consider using a non-alcoholic fluoridated mouthwash to help keep bacteria levels at a minimum. </li>
