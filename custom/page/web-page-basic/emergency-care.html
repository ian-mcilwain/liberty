			<h2>Orthodontic Emergencies</h2>
			<p>True orthodontic emergencies are rare. But when they do occur, we’re available. As a general rule, you should call our office when you experience severe pain or have a painful appliance problem that you can't take care of yourself. We'll schedule an appointment to resolve the problem.</p>

			 <p>You may be able to temporarily solve many problems yourself until you can get to our office. </p>

				<h2>General Soreness</h2>
				<p>Irritated gums and other sore spots can be relieved by rinsing your mouth with a warm salt-water mouthwash. Dissolve one teaspoonful of salt in eight ounces of warm water, and rinse your mouth vigorously. An alternative (better tasting) mouthwash is the Healthy Gums Rinse by The Natural Dentist.</p> 

				<p>You can put wax on the braces to lessen irritation of the lips, cheeks, and tongues. We'll show you how!</p>

				<p>Placing Orabase on the affected area may also help relieve discomfort. Orabase can be found in a pharmacy. If the tenderness is severe, take Acetaminophen (Tylenol). Aspirin, Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) and Naproxen Sodium (Naprosyn, Anaprox) actually slow the tooth movement, so it is not advisable to use them frequently while wearing braces.</p>

				<h2>Headgear</h2>
				<p>Sometimes discomfort is caused by not wearing the headgear as instructed by your orthodontist. Please refer to the instructions provided by your orthodontist. If the facebow (metal piece) is bent, please call our office for assistance. The headgear should hurt less the more it's worn, so be sure you get in the prescribed number of hours.</p>

				<h2>Loose Appliance</h2>
				<p>If your appliance is poking you, place wax on the offending part.</p>

				<h2>Loose Bracket</h2>
				<p>If your bracket or band is still attached to the wire, you should leave it in place and put wax on it if needed for comfort. If the bracket or band can be removed easily, place it in an envelope and save it to bring to your next appointment.</p>

				<h2>Loose Wire</h2>
				<p>Using a pair of tweezers or needle-nosed pliers, try to put your wire back into place. It’s okay to use a piece of floss to tie the wire into place: tie the floss around the bracket in place of the missing coloured o-ring. If you can’t put the wire into a comfortable position and covering the end with wax doesn't help, use a small fingernail clipper to clip the wire behind the last tooth to which it is securely fastened. If the end of the wire is still sharp, place wax on it.</p>

			<h2>Poking Wire</h2>
			<p>Using a pencil eraser, push the poking wire down or place wax on it so that it is no longer poking.</p>

			<p>After alleviating your discomfort, it is very important that you still call our office as soon as possible to schedule a time to repair the problem. Allowing your appliance to remain damaged for an extended period of time may result in disruptions to your treatment plan.</p>
