				<h2>What is dentofacial orthopedics?</h2>
				<p>Dentofacial orthopedics, or growth modification, involves guiding the facial growth and development in children. The aim is to achieve proper balance and structure of the face bones and jaws, as well as the surrounding muscles and soft tissues. </p>
				<h2>What does the treatment involve?</h2>
				<p>Orthopedic treatment can take place with or without conventional braces. The orthodontist diagnoses and treats the teeth, jaws, bones, and surrounding tissues, bringing them into a harmonious equilibrium. While treatments depend on the individual, orthodontic appliances like jaw expanders, jaw positioners, or functional appliances are often used. </p>

					<h2>Orthodontics for Adults</h2>
					<h3>How can orthodontic treatment benefit adults?</h3>
					<p>Getting orthodontic treatment as an adult can improve your overall health as well as your personal and professional life. A beautiful, healthy smile can have a huge impact on your confidence to show your smile. You’ll find yourself smiling and laughing more, and speaking up more readily without the urge to cover your mouth to hide any imperfection.</p>

					<h3>How can orthodontic treatment benefit adults?</h3>
					<p> </p>
					<p>Misaligned teeth can also cause jaw shifting, uneven bite, and distribution of forces, which may lead to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) issues, headaches, ear pain, and gastrointestinal problems from the inability to chew food properly. Correctly aligned teeth are less prone to getting cavities, chipping, becoming irregularly worn down, developing gum or bone disease, and having receding gums.</p>

				<h2>Is it too late to get straight teeth?</h2>
				<p>There’s no age limit for starting orthodontic treatment! Your teeth can move at any age, even if you’ve had braces before. In fact, almost 20% of people in braces today are adults.</p>
				<p>Getting orthodontic treatment as an adult is well worth the investment. With advances in orthodontic technology, you can be assured of little to no disruption to your daily routine. Adult orthodontic treatment options like clear braces and Invisalign (clear aligners) are great alternatives to traditional metal braces. You can achieve improved aesthetics while in treatment without compromising results.</p>

				<h2>What are clear braces?</h2>
				<p>Although some people use this term to refer to Invisalign, clear braces in this case are actually similar to traditional metal braces. Unlike metal braces, however, these are made of ceramic and are white or tooth coloured, which helps the brackets blend in with the shades of natural teeth. The ceramic is generally non-staining.</p>

				<h2>Are clear braces right for you?</h2>
				<p>Clear ceramic braces tend to be used more on upper front teeth than on lower teeth. They can also be used on the lower teeth if the bite is permitting. While they’re visually less prominent, clear braces do require more attention to eating habits as they’re larger and more brittle than their metal counterparts. </p>

					<h2>What is surgical orthodontics?</h2>
					<p>Surgical orthodontics, jaw surgery, or orthognathic surgery treats and corrects jaw irregularities. These irregularities can affect your ability to chew, talk, sleep, and breathe. The surgery also improves facial appearance.</p>

				<h3>Improve your child’s diet and nutrition to avoid cavities and decrease decay and gum diseases. </h3>

				<p>Follow these tips to help your child make tooth-friendly food choices:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Limit sugary foods or drinks, sticky foods, and simple carbohydrates. Most people know candies, pop, cake, cookies, and other sugary foods are bad for our teeth. But be careful! Other foods you might think are healthy can be full of sugar. This includes juice, dried fruit, yogurt, bagels, and crackers. </li>
				
					<li>Eat only fresh fruit, vegetables, firm cheeses, and nuts for snacks between meals. </li>

					<li>Drink only water between meals. Water is good not only because it doesn’t cause cavities, but also because it rinses away food and bacteria, and neutralizes any acids in the mouth. </li>

				<h2>Pacifier and Thumb Sucking</h2>
				<p>It’s completely normal for babies and very young children to suck on their thumbs, fingers, toys, or blankets. If, however, this habit continues past the age of three, it can affect the way the teeth and jaws are growing.</p>
				<h3>Breaking the habit</h3>
				<p>Most children will be able to stop the habit on their own with consistent reminders from parents and the pediatric dentist. In some cases, however, these reminders are not enough and we have to help your child with an appliance.</p>
