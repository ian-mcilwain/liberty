				<h2>What is dentofacial orthopedics?</h2>
				<p>Dentofacial orthopedics, or growth modification, involves guiding the facial growth and development in children. The aim is to achieve proper balance and structure of the face bones and jaws, as well as the surrounding muscles and soft tissues. </p>
				<h2>What does the treatment involve?</h2>
				<p>Orthopedic treatment can take place with or without conventional braces. The orthodontist diagnoses and treats the teeth, jaws, bones, and surrounding tissues, bringing them into a harmonious equilibrium. While treatments depend on the individual, orthodontic appliances like jaw expanders, jaw positioners, or functional appliances are often used. </p>

					<h2>Orthodontics for Adults</h2>
					<h3>How can orthodontic treatment benefit adults?</h3>
					<p>Getting orthodontic treatment as an adult can improve your overall health as well as your personal and professional life. A beautiful, healthy smile can have a huge impact on your confidence to show your smile. You’ll find yourself smiling and laughing more, and speaking up more readily without the urge to cover your mouth to hide any imperfection.</p>

					<h3>How can orthodontic treatment benefit adults?</h3>
					<p> </p>
					<p>Misaligned teeth can also cause jaw shifting, uneven bite, and distribution of forces, which may lead to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) issues, headaches, ear pain, and gastrointestinal problems from the inability to chew food properly. Correctly aligned teeth are less prone to getting cavities, chipping, becoming irregularly worn down, developing gum or bone disease, and having receding gums.</p>

				<h2>Is it too late to get straight teeth?</h2>
				<p>There’s no age limit for starting orthodontic treatment! Your teeth can move at any age, even if you’ve had braces before. In fact, almost 20% of people in braces today are adults.</p>
				<p>Getting orthodontic treatment as an adult is well worth the investment. With advances in orthodontic technology, you can be assured of little to no disruption to your daily routine. Adult orthodontic treatment options like clear braces and Invisalign (clear aligners) are great alternatives to traditional metal braces. You can achieve improved aesthetics while in treatment without compromising results.</p>

				<h2>What are clear braces?</h2>
				<p>Although some people use this term to refer to Invisalign, clear braces in this case are actually similar to traditional metal braces. Unlike metal braces, however, these are made of ceramic and are white or tooth coloured, which helps the brackets blend in with the shades of natural teeth. The ceramic is generally non-staining.</p>

				<h2>Are clear braces right for you?</h2>
				<p>Clear ceramic braces tend to be used more on upper front teeth than on lower teeth. They can also be used on the lower teeth if the bite is permitting. While they’re visually less prominent, clear braces do require more attention to eating habits as they’re larger and more brittle than their metal counterparts. </p>

					<h2>What is surgical orthodontics?</h2>

					<h2>What is sleep apnea?</h2>
					<p>Sleep apnea is a condition in which your breathing stops periodically during sleep. Each time you stop breathing in your sleep, the resulting lack of oxygen alerts your brain, which temporarily wakes you up to restart proper breathing. The constant wake-sleep cycle prevents you from achieving deep sleep. This condition can affect both adults and children and has to be diagnosed by a physician using a sleep study.</p>

				<h2>What does sleep apnea treatment involve?</h2>
				<p>Treatment for sleep apnea depends on the type of apnea and the severity of the case. Besides basic behavioural treatment, oral devices can be used to position the mouth in a way that prevents throat blockage. In more severe cases, surgery might be the best option. </p>

				<p>A diagnosis of sleep apnea must be done by a family physician or a specialist in sleep medicine. </p>

					<h2>Propel Orthodontics</h2>
					<p>In our continuous effort to provide our patients with every orthodontic treatment option available, we are pleased to announce that we now offer Propel®, an orthodontic technique that shortens the time it takes for you to get the smile you are looking for.

					<h2>How does Propel® work?</h2>
					<p>Propel® technology stimulates bone remodelling, which helps teeth move faster and more predictably into the planned positions. The tool creates bone perforations to make orthodontic systems, such as traditional braces and Invisalign, perform more efficiently and move teeth faster. </p> 

					<p>The science behind this technique comes from the process of <span>periodontally accelerated osteogenic orthodontics (PAOO)</span></p>
